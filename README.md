## Docker setup with Vite

The Vite setup enables SSL. On first run, you most likely see a blank page. Open the browser dev tools, go to the network tab, and locate requests to fetch the Vite client. Open this url directly, and your browser should prompt you to accept the risk associated with the unknown certificate. After that you should see the front-end when you visit `meals.test`.
